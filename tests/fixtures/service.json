  "documentation_summary": "This service provides the full imagery set from Sentinel-2 (10m, 20m, 60m) atmospherically corrected, for a specified region of interest.",
  "documentation_description": "Sentinel-2 data products provide global multispectral images. You must provide a region of interest and then a start date and optional end date. For every day from the start to the end (inclusive), atmospherically corrected waveband responses are then output as separate images representing 13 wavebands. The imagery is output as a series of GeoTIFF files, each with a single band representing a waveband. Preview images are also provided. All GeoTIFF files will have the same geographic projection and resolution (up-sampled to 10m). Additional options allow specification of options which control the aggregation of images over a number of days.",
  "documentation_assumptions": "The Sentinel-2 data is taken from the Sinergise S3 repositories of level 1C and level 2A data, and therefore it is assumed that data for the required dates has been published to these repositories.",
